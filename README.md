"Create-your-own-burger" application made in React. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to use

Download or fork the repository, extract it to your computer. In the project directory, 

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

## TO-DO
Base application is done, you can piece together your own burger in the application and click on order. It also has a responsive mobile-first design. Future additions would probably be,

* Configure the application with HTTP/AJAX (adding routes a.k.a routing). Basically add Redux to make it a single-page application.
* User Authentication
* Database stuff for storing order data
